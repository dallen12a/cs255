Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is the client in the market for a program that will allow users to sign up for courses, practice tests, and scheduling a driver for their driving test. The client wants the system to allow people to study and complete their driving tests to acquire licenses.

What did you do particularly well?
In the process I believe I did particularly well at converting the interview transcript provided into a UML diagram.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The part of the design I would revise is the UML Case Diagram with actors and use cases. I feel like knowing more information now can aid in adding more actors important in the flow of the program as well as more advanced use cases to make the program more efficient.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client had specified the actors and use cases in their own way and those were implemented into a UML diagram which would become a user interface and a test and develop process. It is incredibly important to consider the user's needs, because the user is the one who will be actively using the program and they can give a fair amount of insight into all the features or fixes that may need to be developed.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software it is important to hear out what the client wants and transition it into the software. In the future I would invest more time into the client and their wants and needs to develop more effectively.
